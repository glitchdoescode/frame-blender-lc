    def __init__(self):
        self.example_time_money = '''
# Example
## Expression
"Time is money."
## Frames Involved:
### Time Frame
This involves concepts related to the passage of time, such as hours, minutes, schedules, deadlines, etc.
### Money Frame
This involves concepts related to financial transactions, value, budgeting, saving, spending, etc.
## Analysis of the Frame Blending
### Input Spaces
Time: The source frame includes elements like seconds, hours, schedules, deadlines, etc.
Money: The target frame includes elements like currency, investment, expenses, profit, loss, etc.
### Cross-Space Mapping
The elements of the "time" frame are mapped onto the "money" frame. 
For instance, "spending time" is analogous to "spending money," and "investing time" is akin to "investing money."
### Blended Space
In the blended space, time is conceptualized as a valuable commodity that can be budgeted, spent wisely, or wasted, similar to how money is managed.
## Emergent Structure
This blend creates a new understanding where activities are seen through the lens of financial transactions. 
For example, "wasting time" implies a loss similar to wasting money, highlighting the value and scarcity of time.

        self.example_time_thief = '''
# Example
## Expression
"Time is a thief."
## Frames Involved:
### Time Frame
Concepts related to the passage of time, including hours, minutes, aging, and deadlines.
### Theft Frame
Concepts related to stealing, loss, and deprivation.
## Analysis of the Frame Blending
### Input Spaces
Time: Elements like hours, aging, and deadlines.
Theft: Elements like stealing, loss, and being deprived of something valuable.
### Cross-Space Mapping
Time is mapped onto the concept of theft. For instance, aging is seen as something that takes away youth, like a thief.
### Blended Space
Time is conceptualized as a force that steals away youth and opportunities, similar to how a thief steals possessions.
### Emergent Structure
This blend creates an understanding that time causes irreversible loss, much like the permanent loss caused by theft.
